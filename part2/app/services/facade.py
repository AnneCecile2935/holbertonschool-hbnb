"""
Module defining the HBnB facade for centralized access to data repositories.

This module introduces the `HBnBFacade` class, which groups together
the various repository interfaces:
    - users
    - places
    - reviews
    - amenities
and serves as a single entry point for the application's
business logic operations.

This structure helps encapsulate business logic and simplifies
interactions between the API layer and the persistence layer.
