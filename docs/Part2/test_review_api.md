# üß™ Test Documentation ‚Äî Review API

## üìç Introduction

This test suite verifies the core functionalities and edge cases of the Review
API in a Flask application. It ensures that review creation, retrieval,
updating, and deletion behave as expected under both normal and erroneous
conditions.

Each test uses a fresh setup with a dynamically generated user and place,
created via the facade service, to maintain isolation and consistency across
tests.
