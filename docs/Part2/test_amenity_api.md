üìå Notes
All test cases returned the expected status codes and behavior.

The validation for empty or missing name fields is working correctly both on creation and update.

No bugs, regressions, or unhandled edge cases were encountered during this test cycle.

üß™ Recommendation
The Amenity API meets all tested functional and validation requirements. It handles both happy paths and error conditions appropriately. This implementation is considered stable for production assuming all dependent services behave as expected.
