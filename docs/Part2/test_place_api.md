# üß™ Functional Test Report: Place API

## üìå Introduction

This document provides a summary of functional tests executed against the Place
 API endpoints of the application. These tests were designed to validate both
valid and invalid use cases, covering common scenarios such as creation, retrieval,
and updating of place records. The purpose is to ensure the API behaves correctly
in handling various inputs, enforces data constraints, and maintains system integrity.

## üßæ Conclusion

The test suite provides thorough validation of the Place API‚Äôs core functionalities.
 It verifies the handling of both standard and edge-case inputs.
 All tests produced expected results, and no functional defects were identified at this stage.
 The API demonstrates good resilience against malformed data and enforces business rules properly.
 This builds confidence in the reliability and integrity of the place creation and management features.
