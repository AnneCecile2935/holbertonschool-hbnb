# 🛠️ Architecture – Entity Overview (Part 1 – Task 3)

## 🎯 Objective

This document concludes **Part 1** of the HBnB project by summarizing the structure of our main entities, their business role, and how they interact within the system.

It builds upon the previous deliverables:
- the UML package diagram (Task 0),
- the UML class diagram (Task 1),
- and the sequence diagrams (Task 2).

Our goals are to:
- describe the key entities of the application,
- explain their structural relationships,
- link them to the modeled use cases,
- and anticipate their implementation in code.

## 🧱 Main System Entities

| Entity     | Key Attributes                                       | Business Role                                                         | Usage in Use Cases                |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `BaseModel`| `id`, `create_instance`, `update_instance`           | Parent class ensuring entity uniqueness and traceability              | Inherited by all entities         |
| `User`     | `id`, `name`, `surname`, `email`, `password`, `admin`| Represents a platform user (client or admin)                          | Create user, Create review, Create place |
| `Place`    | `id`, `title`, `description`, `price`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `user_id`, `review_ids` | Represents a place offered by a user                        | Create place, Create review, List places |
| `Review`   | `id`, `user_id`, `place_id`, `text`                  | Allows a user to leave feedback on a place                            | Create review                     |
| `Amenity`  | `id`, `name`                                         | Describes a service or feature available at a place                   | Used to filter places             |

🧠 Notes:
- `Amenity` appears in the class diagram but is not directly used in Part 1 use cases → It will be used in later phases.

## 🔗 Relationships Between Entities

Our entities are logically linked as represented in the class diagram.

| Relationship                  | Type             | Technical Detail / Implementation                             |
|------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `User` → `Place`             | One-to-Many      | One user can create multiple places (`Place.user_id`)         |
| `User` → `Review`            | One-to-Many      | One user can write multiple reviews (`Review.user_id`)        |
| `Place` → `Review`           | One-to-Many      | One place can receive multiple reviews (`Review.place_id`)    |
| `Place` → `Amenity`          | Many-to-Many     | A place can have many services, and one service can be reused |
| All Entities → `BaseModel`   | Inheritance       | All entities inherit `BaseModel` (for `id`, timestamps, etc.) |

---

🧠 Notes:

- `One-to-Many` relationships are implemented using **foreign keys** on the “Many” side (e.g. `place_id` in `Review`).
- The `Place` ↔ `Amenity` link requires an **association table** (e.g. `place_amenity`).

---

## 🔄 Entities and Use Cases

Here is how each entity is involved in the use cases modeled in the sequence diagrams:

| Use Case              | Entities Involved                            | Role of Entities                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create user           | `User`, `BaseModel`                          | A new user is created with a unique identifier                     |
| Create place          | `Place`, `User`, `BaseModel`                 | The place is linked to the creator through `user_id`              |
| Create review         | `Review`, `User`, `Place`, `BaseModel`       | The review is linked to both the user and the place (must exist)  |
| List places           | `Place`                                      | The system retrieves places, optionally filtered by `Amenity`     |

---

🧠 Notes:

- These use cases cover the **main system interactions**: creation, relationships, and conditional data retrieval.

## 🛠️ Projection Into Code

Our entities will be implemented as **Python classes**, following a standard object-oriented design.

### 🧱 Shared Structure (Inheritance)

All entities (`User`, `Place`, `Review`, `Amenity`) will inherit from a **common `BaseModel` class**, which will provide:

- a unique ID (`id`)
- a creation timestamp (`create_instance`)
- an update timestamp (`update_instance`)
- common methods such as:
  - `__init__()` – initialization
  - `__str__()` – string representation
  - `save()` – updates `update_instance`

This allows us to **centralize shared behaviors** and **facilitate future extensions** (serialization, persistence, etc.).

### 🧩 Implementation Examples (Pseudocode Only)

| Class     | Specific Attributes                                      | Expected Methods                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `User`    | `name`, `surname`, `email`, `password`, `admin`          | `delete()`, `save()`, `__str__()`      |
| `Place`   | `title`, `description`, `price`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `user_id`, `review_ids`, `amenities` | `save()`, `get_reviews()` |
| `Review`  | `user_id`, `place_id`, `text`                            | `save()`                               |
| `Amenity` | `name`                                                   | `save()`                               |

---

🧠 Notes:

- Attributes like `user_id`, `place_id`, and `review_ids` represent **entity relationships**.
- Some attributes (`amenity`) may be **lists of objects or IDs**.
- The implementation will follow **object-oriented best practices**, separating **data (attributes)** from **behavior (methods)**.

## ✅ Conclusion

This document summarizes our understanding of the object-oriented architecture of the HBnB application.

It highlights:
- the **main entities** used in the system,
- their **structural and functional relationships**,
- their **specific roles within business use cases**,
- and their **technical projection** into Python classes.

This conceptual work sets a solid foundation for future implementation: class definitions, data serialization, API routing, and persistence management.
